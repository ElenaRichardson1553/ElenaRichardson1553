## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I document my journey and projects as a machine learning developer focused on building reliable and interpretable classification and regression models. This space serves as a collection of practical examples and reusable workflows using Scikit-Learn and XGBoost, two of the most powerful libraries in the Python ML ecosystem.

Each project in this repository highlights the full machine learning pipelineâ€”from raw data to deployable modelsâ€”with an emphasis on data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. Whether it's cleaning and transforming messy datasets, selecting features, or optimizing models for performance and generalization, you'll find tools and techniques that reflect industry best practices.

Data Preprocessing: Includes pipelines for handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and splitting datasets to ensure reproducible experiments.

Model Training and Tuning: Demonstrates grid search, random search, and cross-validation techniques to fine-tune Scikit-Learn and XGBoost models for optimal accuracy, precision, and recall.

Evaluation and Visualization: Projects include detailed performance reports with confusion matrices, ROC curves, and feature importance plots to support model interpretation and decision-making.

This repository is aimed at developers, data scientists, and students looking to strengthen their ML skills through well-documented, hands-on examples. Each folder includes annotated code, Jupyter notebooks, and guidance for replicating results or adapting the workflows to your own datasets.

Feel free to explore, fork, or contributeâ€”collaboration and feedback are always welcome!
